# macOmakub

Setup Basecamp/DHH's Omakub terminal + nvim experience on macOS.

## First things first

Omakub uses Alacritty terminal. To have the closest experience, it is recommended that you install it.

But be aware: if you do use it, Natural Text Editing (navigating between words and the beginning and end of lines) won't be possible.
