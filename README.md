# macOmakub

Setup Basecamp/DHH's Omakub terminal + nvim experience on macOS.

## First things first

Omakub uses Alacritty terminal. To have the closest experience, it is recommended that you install it.

But be aware: if you do use it, Natural Text Editing (navigating between words and the beginning and end of lines) won't be possible.

## Starting

1. Install Cascadia Mono: https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
2. Install Alacritty: https://alacritty.org/
3. Run `wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azeveco/macomakub/main/setup | bash`
4. Set Zellij to start automatically: https://zellij.dev/documentation/integration.html
